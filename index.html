      <p>Organ harvesting is when, well, organs are harvested. Organ harvesting can be used for good, like in the case of willing organ donors giving their organs for medical purposes after they die. But it can also be used for illegal purposes, like forced organ harvesting. People can be forced to have their organs surgically removed, like in the case of thousands of Falun Gong practitioners in China. People can also sell their organs willingly on the illegal market, usually getting involved in schemes where donors receive around 3.33% of the proceeds from selling their kidneys, such as a person in a poorer country selling one of their kidneys for $5,000 USD, and an illegal recipient buying it for $120,000 USD, in which case the doctors make all the money from selling the organ.</p>

      <p><br />One of the biggest issues with organ harvesting deals with consent with the patient, as many are dead individuals, and do not establish an agreement beforehand. Not to mention, this practice is heavily unregulated and illegal in most places, thus making issues like these dangerous, but &ldquo;well paying&rdquo;. Morals are difficult to consider since many patients come from poor countries and depend on these practices for extra well needed money. Yet, in legality, as this is unregulated court issues are difficult to follow. The THO Act passed in India however, banned the selling of organs, yet the act still continues to this day. In an extra thought, many mainstream big religions, such as the Catholic Church, do not have comments on organ harvesting, but instead do on donation.</p>

      <p>There are plenty of examples of organ harvesting in many forms of literature. It is a popular topic mainly in science fiction or horror movies. It usually revolves around a futuristic society where people or clones are created and raised specifically to get their insides harvested to give to real citizens of society. Eventually the clones start thinking for themselves and realize the reason behind their creation. Followed by them escaping into the real world and incorporating themselves into society or meeting the person they were cloned after. One example of this is the movie The Island released in 2005 by director Michael Bay. It follows an entire society in a containment facility where people try their best to go to &ldquo;the island", a paradise on earth that citizens try to get to by work and good deeds. Unfortunately, there is no island, and as it turns out, all the inhabitants of the facility are clones of rich people in the real world, and when they need a new body part, they pay a company to manufacture a perfect clone of themselves to harvest organs and body parts from. The creation of clones prevents the body from rejecting any of the organs, as we see the clone perfectly matches the real person, down to the fingerprints and the corneas.</p>

      <p>Our group strongly believes that illegal organ harvesting be illegal. This is because illegal organ harvesting is both unethical and dangerous for both the donor and the recipient. This is because when organs are harvested illegally, you do not know who and in what conditions the organ was taken out, and how it was handled before being transplanted. Illegal organ harvesting and transplant also preys on people who have less money. This is because people with less money are willing to sell their organs to make ends meet, and rich people buy the organs off the poor people. The root to this problem is the fact that there are not that many organs available for transplant. To fix this problem, we need to make selling organs legal. You may think this will accelerate the process of people doing shady things, you are wrong. There are many people in the world that believe that they have a right to sell their own organs. So, if we combine these things together, we can make a legal and licensed organ market. If we do this, we will get more organ that we can give to people who are in need.</p>
