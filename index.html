        <p>
            Organ harvesting is when, well, organs are harvested. Organ harvesting can be used for good, like in the
            case of
            willing organ donors giving their organs for medical purposes after they die. But it can also be used for
            illegal
            purposes, like forced organ harvesting. People can be forced to have their organs surgically removed, like
            in
            the case of thousands of Falun Gong practitioners in China. People can also sell their organs willingly on
            the
            illegal market, usually getting involved in schemes where donors receive around 3.33% of the proceeds from
            selling their kidneys, such as a person in a poorer country selling one of their kidneys for $5,000 USD, and
            an
            illegal recipient buying it for $120,000 USD, in which case the doctors make all the money from selling the
            organ.

                <h2 class="subheading">Legality/Ethics of Organ Harvesting</h2>
            </div>

        </div>
        <p>
        <ul>
            <li><strong>Ethics</strong>:
                <br>In terms of organ transplantation,
                as long as the donator has consented to said operation, then the ethics in that
                situation can be “ignored”. Yet, the nature of harvesting for the purpose of illegal
                sale has brought several issues that conflict with this. For one, there are cases
                where people are forced to continue with these operations, which can cost them their
                life if done unsafely. These cases are as a result of consent simply being ignored.
                The overall idea of selling organs for money is a difficult case, since most of the time
                these situations are unregulated, and secreted, and thus do not receive much public attention.
                Yet, a census of “if the person agrees, it’s fine” is the common outlook, even if the donor is
                forced from poverty. There are also cases where people who are already dead have their organs taken
                from them, which once more without proper consent, acts as a violation to the person, and their family.
            </li>
            <li><strong>Morals</strong>: <br>As before mentioned, many people simply do not have a choice in this.
                In a previous presentation, we established that countries such as Puerto Rico depend on harvesting
                in order to provide people, who live with a low GDP with some form of extra money. Unfortunately,
                this follows dark morals, as people find no issue with giving up parts of their body, simply for cash
                they could not get from jobs.
            </li>
            <li><strong>Legality</strong>: <br> These markets and practices are unregulated and illegal in several
                countries. That being said, he harvesting aspect follows difficult legal issues, such as the THO
                act passed in India. Even though the selling of organs was illegal, scandals of selling kidneys was
                still often reported, thus pushing the moral aspect of needing to sell to make a living. These
                situations,
                if I can add, happen often with dead individuals, which push the question of consent beforehand.
            </li>
            <li><strong>Extra</strong>: <br> Many mainstream religions, such as Roman Catholicism, approve of organ
                donations
                , as they believe the act of sharing, especially in saving a life, is an act of kindness and good.
                However,
                these religions do not tend to mention selling organs, or illegal organ trade. Perhaps we can consider
                its illegality,
                and thus pushing the idea that if its not allowed, you shouldn’t do it.
            </li>

        </div>
        <p>Our group strongly believes that illegal organ harvesting be illegal. This is because illegal organ
            harvesting is both unethincal and dangerous for both the donor and the recipinet. This is because when
            organs are harvested illegally, you do not know who and in what conditions the organ was taken out, and how
            it was handled before being transplanted. Illegal organ harvesting and transplant also preys on people who
            have less money. THis is because people with less money are willing to sell their organs to make ends meet,
            and rich people buy the organs off of the poor people. The root to this problem is the fact that there are
            not that many organs available for transplant. To fix this problem, we need to make selling organs legal.
            You may think this will accelerate the process of people doing shady things, you are wrong. There are many
            people in the world that believe that they have a right to sell their own organs. So, if we combine these
            things together, we can make a legal and licensed organ market. If we do this, we will get more organ that
            we can give to people who are in need.</p>
